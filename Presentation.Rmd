# Initial presentation

## Initial presentation

- <font size="5">59 yo female with a h/o morbid obesity, chronic vertigo, hypertension, and a recent episode of necrotizing fasciitis to the mons pubis. She presented as a transfer from SNF for hypotension.</font>

> - <font size="4">Since her hospitalization at OSUE she had been in a SNF recovering. She has been having chronic diarrhea and poor po intake which was worse over the past week with frequent NBNB emesis and watery diarrhea.</font>

> - <font size="4">Routine vitals at SNF and she was found to be hypotensive to 80s systolic. She was seen at MCH where she was found to be hypotensive (lowest 79/46), and was reportedly febrile. Started on phenylephrine. There was concern for UTI based on urinalysis (had indwelling foley, last changed 1 week ago) and was started on Cefepime. Lactate was wnl. There was evidence of AKI on labs and elevated troponin.</font>


> - <font size="5">On arrival, the patient reported some nausea and then had a somewhat bilious emesis. Denied symptoms other than normal vertigo.</font>

# Differential?

## Vitals on arrival

BP = 107/67 <br>
HR = 106 <br>
SpO2 = 95% on RA <br>
RR = 26 <br>
Temp = 99.3 <br>
Drips = phenyleprine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min

## Physical exam

- AOx4, No distress, Overweight, Laying in bed
- Cardiopulmonary exam was wnl
- Mild epigastric tenderness
- Foley in place
<br><br><br><br>
- Site of prior debridement of left groin with healthy granulation tissue. 
- I&D site on right lower abdomen with packing in place without drainage. 
- Over the right upper abdomen there are clusters of vesicles that appear to be crusted over in the region of T6 dermatome on the right. 

# Things to order?

## Labs

- Na 141, K 4.6, Cl 110, HCO3 17, Cr 1.2
- LFTs wnl
- Trop 0.4
- WBC 13.4, Hgb 11.3, Plt 341
- Lactate 1.8
<br><br>
- POC flu negative
- Procal 0.09, CRP 13.3
- UA off exchanged foley:
<font size="4"><br>Turbid, Large Blood, >20 WBCs, Small LE, Nitrites negative</font>

## Imaging

- Chest xr: 
<font size="4"><br>Life support devices as described above. No acute cardiopulmonary findings.</font>

- CT A/P: <br>
<font size="4">1.) Previously described ill-defined region of stranding and gas within the perineum is nonvisualized on today's exam, likely out of the field-of-view <br>
2.) Multiple nonspecific prominent para-aortic, pelvic sidewall, and inguinal lymph nodes are stable-slightly decreased in size from the prior exam. <br>
3.) Cholelithiasis. No specific evidence of acute cholecystitis. <br>
4.) Multiple bilateral hyperdense renal cystic lesions, some of which are new from the prior exam. These are incompletely characterized and may represent hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cysts. Underlying renal neoplasia cannot be excluded on this exam. <br>
5.) Circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening may in part be related to underdistention. Consider correlation with urinalysis to exclude acute cystitis. <br></font>

## Updates and what was done...

> - Became a bit hypotensive so bolused 1L and phenylephrine increased to 1 mcg/kg/min<br><br>
- Started on broad antibiotics including dapto, cefepime, flagyl, acyclovir<br><br>
- After one dose of cefepime and flagyl, switched to merrem<br><br>
- After one dose of acyclovir switched to valtrex<br><br>
- Temp increased to 100.3 overnight

# Day one 

## Day one update

- NAE, still on phenylephrine at stable dose

> - Phenylephrine quickly weaned off in the morning and pt went hypotensive <br>__Started on levophed__

> - Vitals: HR 101, MAPs consistently around 65, RR 18-24, Temp 100.2, RA 

> - Exam: AOx4, NAD, Seems completely fine, Eating normally

> - More information from past hospitalization: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;__Candida glabrata__ at high CFU in urine <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;__Lactobacillus gasseri__ on anaerobic of mons pubis <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;__Candida glabrata__ on fungal of mons pubis wound <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Various __ESBL bugs__ on standard culture of mons pubis wound

## Day one labs



# Refine differential, orders?

# Day two

## Day two update

- NAE, levophed weaned to 0.02 mg/kg/min overnight

> - levophed requirement increased back to 0.08 mg/kg/min

> - Vitals: HR 95, MAPs are variable, RR 20-33, Temp 98, SpO2 92% on RA 

> - Exam: AOx4, NAD, Still completely fine

## Day two labs

> - Blood cx: NGTD <br>Urine cx: Massive growth 

> - Management: Started pt on caspofungin for Candida on last admission

# Refine differential, orders?

# Day three

## Day three updates

- NAE, levophed stable at about 0.1 mg/kg/min, unable to wean

> - Vitals: Unchanged

> - Drips: Still requiring 0.07 mcg/kg/min to maintain MAPs > 65

> - Exam: AOx4, NAD, Still completely fine

> - More information: Nothing new on cultures

## Day three labs



## New imaging

> - TTE: <font size="4"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall image quality is good. Tachycardic during exam. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The LV chamber size is small, partially compressed by the RV. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Systolic function is hyperdynamic, EF >70% <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The right ventricle is severely enlarged (RV : LV ratio is 1.5-2 : 1). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is severe RV dysfunction.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Septal motion is consistent with right ventricular pressure and volume overload. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is free wall hypokinesis. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is aortic sclerosis without stenosis. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderately elevated pulmonary pressures, estimated RVSP 60-65 mmHg. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;No evidence of right to left shunt by saline bubble study.</font>
